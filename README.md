# AceGen: A TorchRL-based toolkit for reinforcement learning in generative chemistry

## Overview

In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has been increasingly used in drug design to propose molecules with specific properties under defined constraints. However, RL problems are inherently complex, featuring independent and interchangeable components with diverse method signatures and data requirements.

AceGen applies TorchRL - a modern general decision-making library that provides well-integrated reusable components - to make a robust toolkit tailored for generative drug design.

## Running training scripts

To run the training scripts, run

    python scripts/a2c/a2c.py

To modify training parameters, edit the corresponding YAML file in each example's directory.

# Available models

We provide a variety of example priors that can be selected in the configuration file. These include:

- A Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model
  - pre-training dataset1 (default): [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/)
  - pre-training dataset2: [ZINC250k](https://github.com/wenhao-gao/mol_opt/blob/main/data/zinc.txt.gz)
  - umber of parameters: 4,363,045


- A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model
  - pre-training dataset: [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/)
  - number of parameters: 5,807,909
 

- A GPT-2 model
  - pre-training dataset: [REAL 350/3 lead-like, 613.86M cpds, CXSMILES](https://enamine.net/compound-collections/real-compounds/real-database-subsets)
  - number of parameters: 5,030,400

  
# Integration of custom models

We encourage users to integrate their own models into AceGen, modifying the existing code as needed.

`/acegen/models/gru.py` and `/acegen/models/lstm.py` offer methods to create RNNs of varying sizes, which can be use
to load custom models. Similarly, `/acegen/models/gpt2.py` can serve as a template for integrating HuggingFace models.
